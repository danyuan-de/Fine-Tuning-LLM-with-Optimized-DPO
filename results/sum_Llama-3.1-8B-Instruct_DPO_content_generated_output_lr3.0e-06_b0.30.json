There are two main statements of the second law: the Kelvin-Planck statement and the Clausius statement.\n\nTo determine the Clausius statement, we need to consider the concept of entropy, which is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. The Clausius statement is based on the idea that it is impossible to construct a heat engine that can convert all the heat energy put into it into useful work.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Consider a heat engine that operates in a cycle, taking in heat from a high-temperature reservoir and converting it into work.\n2. The engine is assumed to be perfect, meaning it has 100% efficiency, and all the heat energy put into it is converted into useful work.\n3. However, this would imply that the heat engine can decrease the entropy of the high-temperature reservoir, which is a violation of the concept of entropy as a measure of disorder or randomness.\n4. Since entropy always increases in a spontaneous process, it is impossible to construct a heat engine that can convert all the heat energy into useful work.\n5.

The area of the rod that is perpendicular to the magnetic field at any given time is $A = Lw$, where $L$ is the length of the rod and $w$ is the width of the rod. However, since the problem does not specify the width of the rod, we will assume it is a thin rod, and the area is effectively the length of the rod times the radius of the circle it traces out, which is $A = Lr$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. However, for a thin rod rotating in a uniform field, the area through which the flux changes is effectively the length of the rod times the radius of the circle it traces out, but since we are considering the flux change due to the rod's rotation, we actually consider the rod's length as the area that changes flux as it rotates.
