There are two main statements of the second law: the Kelvin-Planck statement and the Clausius statement.\n\nTo determine the Clausius statement, we need to consider the concept of entropy, which is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. The Clausius statement is based on the idea that it is impossible to construct a heat engine that can convert all the heat energy put into it into useful work.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Consider a heat engine that operates in a cycle, taking in heat from a high-temperature reservoir and converting it into work.\n2. The engine is assumed to be perfect, meaning it has 100% efficiency, and all the heat energy put into it is converted into useful work.\n3. However, this would imply that the heat engine can decrease the entropy of the high-temperature reservoir, which is a violation of the concept of entropy as a measure of disorder or randomness.\n4. Therefore, it is impossible to construct a heat engine that can convert all the heat energy put into it into useful work, which means that the efficiency of any heat engine must be less than 100%.\n\nThe Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics is:\n\n\"No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a body at a lower temperature to a body at a higher temperature.\"\n\nIn other words, it is impossible to transfer heat spontaneously from a colder body to a hotter body without any other effects. This statement is a concise and elegant way to express the idea that entropy always increases in a spontaneous process.\n\nFinal answer: The Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics is: \"No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a body at a lower temperature to a body at a higher temperature.\"",

It is named after Rudolf Clausius, who first formulated it in the 19th century.\n\n3. **Recalling the Clausius statement**: The Clausius statement is often phrased as: \"No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder to a hotter body.\"\n\n4. **Interpreting the statement**: This statement essentially means that heat naturally flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature, but not the reverse. It's a fundamental principle that explains why you can't build a machine that can transfer heat from a cold body to a hot body without any other effects.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics is a concise and clear expression of the direction of spontaneous heat transfer, emphasizing that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.\n\n**Final Answer:** The Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics is: \"No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder to a hotter body.\"",
