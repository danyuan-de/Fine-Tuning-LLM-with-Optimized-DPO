A charged particle with charge $q = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{C}$ is placed at the origin and then released from rest. We need to calculate the work done by the electric field when the particle moves to the point $(x = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}, y = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{m})$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the force acting on the charged particle\nThe force acting on the charged particle due to the electric field is given by the equation $F = qE$. Since the electric field is directed along the positive x-axis, the force on the charged particle will also be directed along the positive x-axis.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the magnitude of the force acting on the charged particle\nThe magnitude of the force acting on the charged particle is given by $F = qE = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{C})(500\\,\\mathrm{V/m}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-",
