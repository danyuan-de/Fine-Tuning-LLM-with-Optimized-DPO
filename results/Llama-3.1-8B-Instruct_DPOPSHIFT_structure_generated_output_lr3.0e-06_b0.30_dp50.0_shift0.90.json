Mathematically, it is represented as H = U + PV.\n\n## Step 2: Significance of Enthalpy\nEnthalpy is a measure of the total energy of a system, including both the internal energy and the energy associated with the pressure and volume of a system. It is a crucial concept in thermodynamics because it helps in understanding the energy changes in a system during processes such as heating, cooling, expansion, and compression.\n\n## Step 3: Relationship with Other Thermodynamic Properties\nEnthalpy is closely related to other thermodynamic properties such as internal energy (U), pressure (P), and volume (V).
