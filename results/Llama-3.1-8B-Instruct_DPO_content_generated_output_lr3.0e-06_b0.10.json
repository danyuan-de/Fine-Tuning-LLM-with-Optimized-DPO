        "ref_response": "To solve this problem, we'll consider the key factors that influence the motion of the spheres as they roll down the inclined plane. The two main factors to consider are the moment of inertia and the torque acting on each sphere.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the Moment of Inertia\nThe moment of inertia (I) is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation. It depends on the mass distribution of the object relative to the axis of rotation. For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia about its central axis is \\(I_{solid} = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2\\), where M is the mass of the sphere and R is its radius. For a hollow sphere, the moment of inertia about its central axis is \\(I_{hollow} = \\frac{2}{3}MR^2\\).\n\n## Step 2: Understanding Torque and Rotational Kinetic Energy\nAs the spheres roll down the inclined plane, they experience a torque due to the force of gravity acting on them. The torque (\\(\\tau\\)) is given by \\(\\tau = r \\times F\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the sphere and \\(F\\) is the force acting on it. For both spheres, the force is due to gravity, and since they are on an inclined plane, the force can be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the plane. However, the component parallel to the plane is what contributes to the torque causing rotation.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing the Rotational Kinetic Energy\nThe rotational kinetic energy of an object is given by \\(KE_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2\\), where \\(I\\) is the moment of inertia and \\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity. The linear kinetic energy is given by \\(KE_{lin} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass and \\(v\\) is the linear velocity.\n\n## Step 4: Comparing the Rotational and Linear Kinetic Energy\nFor both spheres, the linear kinetic energy at the bottom of the inclined plane will be the same since they start from rest and are under the sole influence of gravity. However, the rotational kinetic energy depends on the moment of inertia. The solid sphere has a higher moment of inertia than the hollow sphere, meaning it will have more resistance to changes in its rotation.\n\n## Step 5: Applying the Law of Conservation of Energy\nAs the spheres roll",

When an object rolls without slipping, its motion consists of both translational motion (movement down the inclined plane) and rotational motion (rotation around its axis).\n\n## Step 1: Identify the types of energy involved\nBoth spheres start from rest at the same height, so they have potential energy due to their height. As they roll down the inclined plane, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which includes both translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the moment of inertia\nThe moment of inertia (I) is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation. It depends on the mass distribution of the object relative to the axis of rotation. For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia about its diameter (which is the axis of rotation when rolling down an inclined plane) is \\(I_{solid} = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2\\), where M is the mass of the sphere and R is its radius. For a hollow sphere, the moment of inertia about its diameter is \\(I_{hollow} = \\frac{2}{3}MR^2\\).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the rotational kinetic energy\nThe rotational kinetic energy of an object is given by \\(KE_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity. Since both spheres start from rest and roll without slipping, their linear velocity (v) and angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)) are related by \\(\\omega = \\frac{v}{R}\\). The total kinetic energy (translational + rotational) is converted from the initial potential energy, but the rotational kinetic energy depends on the moment of inertia.\n\n## Step 4: Compare the moments of inertia\nGiven that \\(I_{solid} = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2\\) and \\(I_{hollow} = \\frac{2}{3}MR^2\\), the hollow sphere has a larger moment of inertia than the solid sphere. This means that for the same angular velocity, the hollow sphere will have more rotational kinetic energy than the solid sphere.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the effect on acceleration\nThe acceleration of an object rolling down an inclined plane is determined by the net force acting on it (gravity and friction) and its moment of inertia",

Given that F(x) = 5x, we can substitute this into the integral to get W = \u222b5x dx.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the integral\nTo solve the integral \u222b5x dx, we use the power rule of integration, which states that \u222bx^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C. In this case, n = 1, so \u222b5x dx = (5/2)x^2 + C. However, since we are calculating work, which is a definite integral, we need to evaluate the integral from the initial displacement (0 m) to the final displacement (2 m). Therefore, the work done is W = [(5/2)x^2] from 0 to 2.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the definite integral\nTo evaluate the definite integral [(5/2)x^2] from 0 to 2, we substitute the upper and lower limits into the integral and subtract the results: W = [(5/2)(2)^2] - [(5/2)(0)^2] = (5/2)(4) - 0 = 10 J.\n\nThe final answer is:",

It depends on the object's mass, velocity, and the distance from the axis of rotation. The formula for angular momentum (L) is given by L = r x p, where r is the radius vector from the axis of rotation to the object, and p is the linear momentum of the object.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the initial angular momentum of the system\nThe initial angular momentum of the system can be calculated by considering the angular momentum of each planet before the collision. For the first planet of mass m moving at speed v, its linear momentum is p1 = m * v. Since we are not given the radius of the orbit, we assume the planet is moving in a straight line and the radius (r) is not applicable. Therefore, the initial angular momentum of the first planet is L1 = r1 * p1 = r1 * m * v. For the second planet of mass M, its initial angular momentum is L2 = r2 * p2 = r2 * M * 0 (since it's initially at rest).\n\n## Step 3: Consider the collision and the conservation of angular momentum\nIn an inelastic collision, the two objects stick together and move as one object after the collision.

Since there are no external torques, the total angular momentum is conserved.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final angular momentum of the system\nAfter the collision, the two planets are moving together as one object with a combined mass of m + M. The velocity of the combined object can be found using the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the collision is m * v + M * 0 = m * v. After the collision, the combined object has a momentum of (m + M) * v'. We can equate the two expressions and solve for v': m * v = (m + M) * v'. Solving for v' gives v' = m * v / (m + M).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final angular momentum\nThe final angular momentum of the system is the angular momentum of the combined object.

However, since the motion is horizontal, the weight does not contribute to the centripetal force required for circular motion. Therefore, the tension in the cord is the primary force responsible for the circular motion.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for centripetal force\nThe centripetal force (F_c) required for an object to move in a circular path is given by the formula F_c = (m * v^2) / r, where m is the mass of the object, v is its velocity, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the centripetal force in this scenario\nIn this case, the centripetal force is provided by the tension (T) in the cord. Therefore, we can set the tension equal to the centripetal force: T = (m * v^2) / r.\n\n## Step 4: Plug in the given values\nGiven that the mass (m) is 2 kg, the tension (T) is 40 N, and the radius (r) of the circle (which is the length of the cord) is 2 m, we can substitute these values into the equation from step 3: 40 = (2 * v^2) / 2.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for v\nTo find the speed (v), we need to rearrange the equation to solve for v^2.

However, since we are not given the mass of the pendulum, we will express the initial potential energy in terms of the given variables and constants.\n\n## Step 4: Express the initial potential energy in terms of the given variables and constants\nThe height $h$ of the pendulum above its equilibrium position can be calculated using the formula $h = L(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $L$ is the length of the pendulum and $\\theta$ is the angle from the vertical. Substituting the given values, we get $h = 1.2(1 - \\cos(10^\\circ))$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the initial potential energy\nSubstituting the expression for $h$ into the formula for potential energy, we get $PE = m \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot 1.2(1 - \\cos(10^\\circ))$. However, we need to express the initial potential energy in terms of the final kinetic energy to find the maximum speed.\n\n## Step 6: Express the final kinetic energy\nAt the bottom of its swing, all the initial potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy. The kinetic energy (KE) of the pendulum can be calculated using the formula $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the speed of the pendulum.\n\n## Step 7: Equate the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy\nSince energy",

The melting of ice at $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ involves a phase transition from solid (ice) to liquid (water). This process is known as the melting point of ice.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the Melting Process\nThe melting of ice at $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is a first-order phase transition. In a first-order phase transition, the temperature remains constant during the transition. This is because the energy required to change the state of the substance (in this case, from solid to liquid) is provided by the latent heat of fusion, which is a constant value for a given substance at a given temperature.\n\n## Step 2: Latent Heat of Fusion\nThe latent heat of fusion is the amount of heat required to change a unit mass of a substance from the solid to the liquid phase without a change in temperature. For water, the latent heat of fusion is approximately $334 \\, \\text{J/g}$. This value indicates that as ice melts at $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the temperature of the ice-water mixture remains constant at $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ until all the ice has melted.\n\n## Step 3: Temperature During Melting\nGiven that the melting process involves the absorption of latent heat without a change in temperature, the temperature of the ice does not change during the melting process. The heat energy is used to break the bonds between the water molecules in the solid state, allowing them to move freely in the liquid state, rather than increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules, which would cause a temperature increase.\n\n## Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on the principles of thermodynamics and the definition of the melting point, the temperature of the ice remains constant at $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ during the melting process.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This heat energy is used to break the bonds holding the water molecules in the solid state, allowing them to transition into the liquid state. The key point here is that this process occurs at a constant temperature because the melting point is the temperature at which the phase transition occurs without a change in temperature.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if the temperature changes\nGiven that the melting process occurs at a constant temperature (the melting point of ice, which is $0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), the temperature of the ice does not change during the melting process.
