When it reaches its dew point, the water vapor condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds.\n\n**Step 3: Precipitation**\nWhen the clouds become saturated with water, the droplets combine to form larger droplets, which eventually become too heavy to remain suspended in the air. This leads to precipitation in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n**Step 4: Runoff and Infiltration**\nOnce the precipitation reaches the ground, it can either flow over the surface as runoff or seep into the soil as infiltration. Runoff can collect in low-lying areas and flow into bodies of water, while infiltration helps to recharge groundwater aquifers.\n\n**Step",

As the water vapor in the clouds cools down, it condenses into droplets, forming clouds.\n\nWhen the clouds become saturated with water, the water droplets combine to form larger droplets, which eventually become too heavy to remain suspended in the air. At this point, the water falls back to the Earth as precipitation, which can take the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\nOnce the precipitation reaches the ground, some of it is absorbed into the soil, recharging groundwater and eventually feeding plants and animals.
