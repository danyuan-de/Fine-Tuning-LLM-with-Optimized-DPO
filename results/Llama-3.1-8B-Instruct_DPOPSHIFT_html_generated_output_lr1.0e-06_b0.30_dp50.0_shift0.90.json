However, at the top of the circle, the normal force (N) is equal in magnitude to the tension (T) but opposite in direction.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the direction of the forces at the top of the circle\nAt the top of the circle, the tension (T) is directed downwards, the weight (mg) is also directed downwards, and the normal force (N) is directed upwards.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Newton's second law of motion\nTo find the tension at the top of the circle, we need to consider the net force acting on the mass. Since the mass is moving in a uniform circular motion, the net force must be directed towards the center of the circle. This means that the net force is the vector sum of the tension (T) and the weight (mg).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the net force\nThe net force (F_net) is given by the equation F_net = T -",
