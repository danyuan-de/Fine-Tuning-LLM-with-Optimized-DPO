Mathematically, it is represented as $I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}$, where $I$ is the current, $\\Delta Q$ is the charge that passes a given point, and $\\Delta t$ is the time over which the charge flows.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total charge that passes a given point\nWe are given that the current $I = 5\\,\\mathrm{A}$ and the time $\\Delta t = 2\\,\\mathrm{minutes}$. We need to convert the time from minutes to seconds because the unit of current is in amperes (A), which is coulombs per second (C/s). There are $60$ seconds in a minute, so $2\\,\\mathrm{minutes} = 2 \\times 60 = 120\\,\\mathrm{seconds}$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the formula for current to find the total charge\nWe can rearrange the formula for current to solve for $\\Delta Q$: $\\Delta Q = I \\times \\Delta t$. Substituting the given values, we get $\\Delta Q = 5\\,\\mathrm{A} \\times 120\\,\\mathrm{s} = 600\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of electrons\nTo find the number of electrons, we divide the total charge by the charge of a single electron. The charge of an electron is given as $e = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$. Therefore, the number of electrons is $\\frac{\\Delta Q}{e} = \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{C}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the division to find the number of electrons\n$\\frac{600}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}} = 3.75 \\times 10^{21}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3.75 \\times 10^{21}}$",

There are two main statements of the second law: the Kelvin-Planck statement and the Clausius statement.\n\nTo determine the Clausius statement, we need to consider the concept of entropy, which is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. The Clausius statement is based on the idea that it is impossible to construct a heat engine that can convert all the heat energy put into it into useful work.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Consider a heat engine that operates in a cycle, taking in heat from a high-temperature reservoir and converting it into work.\n2. The engine is assumed to be perfect, meaning it has 100% efficiency, and all the heat energy put into it is converted into useful work.\n3. However, this would imply that the heat engine can decrease the entropy of the high-temperature reservoir, which is a violation of the concept of entropy as a measure of disorder or randomness.\n4. Therefore, it is impossible to construct a heat engine that can convert all the heat energy put into it into useful work, which means that the efficiency of any heat engine must be less than 100%.\n\nThe Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics is:\n\n\"No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a body at a lower temperature to a body at a higher temperature.\"\n\nIn other words, it is impossible to transfer heat spontaneously from a colder body to a hotter body without any other effects. This statement is a concise and elegant way to express the idea that entropy always increases in a spontaneous process.\n\nFinal answer: The Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics is: \"No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a body at a lower temperature to a body at a higher temperature.\"",

It has several statements, but the question specifically asks for the Clausius statement.\n\n2. **Identifying the Clausius statement**: The Clausius statement is one of the two main formulations of the second law of thermodynamics. It is named after Rudolf Clausius, who first formulated it in the 19th century.\n\n3. **Recalling the Clausius statement**: The Clausius statement is often phrased as: \"No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder to a hotter body.\"\n\n4. **Interpreting the statement**: This statement essentially means that heat naturally flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature, but it cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body without external work being done.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics is a concise way of expressing the direction of spontaneous heat transfer, emphasizing that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.\n\n**Final Answer:** The Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics is: \"No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder to a hotter body.\"",

        "ref_response": "## Step 1: Identify the type of problem and relevant physics principles\nThis problem involves a metal rod rotating in a uniform magnetic field, which suggests the use of Faraday's law of induction and the concept of a changing magnetic flux. The key principle here is that a changing magnetic flux through a loop induces an electromotive force (emf) in the loop.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the relevant parameters\n- The length of the rod, $L = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- The angular velocity of the rod, $\\omega = 10\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- The magnetic field strength, $B = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n- The axis of rotation is at one end of the rod, which implies the rod is rotating in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the loop\nSince the rod is rotating, we can consider it as a loop with a changing area. The area of the loop can be calculated as the product of the length of the rod and its width. However, the width of the rod is not given, but since the rod is rotating in a uniform field, we can consider the area of the loop as the area swept by the rod as it rotates. For a rod of length $L$ rotating at an angle $\\theta$ from the magnetic field, the area of the loop is $A = L^2 \\sin(\\theta)$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the rate of change of the area\nSince the rod is rotating, the area of the loop is changing. The rate of change of the area with respect to time can be found by differentiating the area with respect to time. Given that $\\theta = \\omega t$, we have $\\frac{dA}{dt} = L^2 \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Faraday's law of induction\nFaraday's law of induction states that the induced emf is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop. The magnetic flux through the loop is given by $\\Phi = BA \\cos(\\theta)$. The rate of change of the flux is $\\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} = B \\frac{dA}{dt}$.

Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{\\sin(\\theta_1)}{\\sin(\\theta_2)} = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$, where $\\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence, $\\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the first and second media, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's Law to the given problem\nGiven that the light ray is incident at $30^{\\circ}$ in water ($n_1 = 1.33$) and passes into glass ($n_2 = 1.52$), we can substitute these values into Snell's Law to find the angle of refraction $\\theta_2$.

Time dilation occurs when an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer measures time passing more slowly for the stationary observer.\n## Step 2:  The formula for time dilation is given by $t = \\gamma t_0$, where $t$ is the time measured by the stationary observer, $t_0$ is the time measured by the moving clock, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor given by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$, where $v$ is the velocity of the moving clock and $c$ is the speed of light.\n## Step 3:  In this problem, the moving clock ticks once every $10\\,\\mathrm{s}$, so $t_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The velocity of the moving clock is $v = 0.9c$.\n## Step 4:  We can now substitute these values into the time dilation formula to find the time measured by the stationary observer.\n## Step 5:  First, we calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.9c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.81}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.19}} = \\frac{1}{0.4359} = 2.294$.\n## Step 6:  Now, we can use the time dilation formula to find the time measured by the stationary observer: $t = \\gamma t_0 = 2.294 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{s} = 22.94\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the time measured by the stationary observer is $22.94\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{22.94}$",

Setting this equal to the kinetic energy gained, we have $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 1.6 \\times 10^{-15}$.
