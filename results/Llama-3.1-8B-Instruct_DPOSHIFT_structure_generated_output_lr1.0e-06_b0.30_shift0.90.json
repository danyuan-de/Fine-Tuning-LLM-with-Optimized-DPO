The relevant principle here is the one related to the change in magnetic flux through a loop.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the area of the loop\nSince the rod is moving perpendicularly through the magnetic field, we can consider the rod as a straight wire of length $L$ and treat it as a loop of area $A = L \\times w$, where $w$ is the width of the rod. However, the problem does not provide the width of the rod, but we can assume it to be negligible for the purpose of this calculation since the area of the rod is not directly relevant to the calculation of the induced emf in this scenario. The area of the rod is not necessary for the calculation of the induced emf in this case because the induced emf is given by the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the rod, and the rod's area does not change as it",
