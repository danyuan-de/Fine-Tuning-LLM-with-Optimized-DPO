Mathematically, it is represented as $I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}$, where $I$ is the current, $\\Delta Q$ is the charge that passes a given point, and $\\Delta t$ is the time over which the charge flows.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total charge that passes a given point\nWe are given that the current $I = 5\\,\\mathrm{A}$ and the time $\\Delta t = 2\\,\\mathrm{minutes}$. We need to convert the time from minutes to seconds because the unit of current is in amperes (A), which is coulombs per second (C/s). There are $60$ seconds in a minute, so $2\\,\\mathrm{minutes} = 2 \\times 60 = 120\\,\\mathrm{seconds}$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the formula for current to find the total charge\nWe can rearrange the formula for current to solve for $\\Delta Q$: $\\Delta Q = I \\times \\Delta t$. Substituting the given values, we get $\\Delta Q = 5\\,\\mathrm{A} \\times 120\\,\\mathrm{s} = 600\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of electrons\nTo find the number of electrons, we divide the total charge by the charge of a single electron. The charge of an electron is given as $e = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$. Therefore, the number of electrons is $\\frac{\\Delta Q}{e} = \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{C}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the division to find the number of electrons\n$\\frac{600}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}} = 3.75 \\times 10^{21}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3.75 \\times 10^{21}}$",

This time is the total time of flight for the ball.\n## Step 5:  To find the height of the cliff, we need to determine the vertical displacement of the ball during its flight. We can use the equation for vertical displacement under constant acceleration, which is $y = v_{0y}t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$, where $y$ is the displacement, $v_{0y}$ is the initial vertical velocity (which is $0$ since the ball is thrown horizontally), $t$ is the time, and $a$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n## Step 6:  Since the ball starts from rest and is thrown horizontally, the initial vertical velocity $v_{0y}$ is $0$. The equation simplifies to $y = \\frac{1}{2}at^2$.\n## Step 7:  Plugging in the given values, we get $y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2} \\times (3.0\\,\\mathrm{s})^2$.\n## Step 8:  Calculating this gives us $y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 9 = 44.1\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the height of the cliff is $44.1\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{44.1}$",
