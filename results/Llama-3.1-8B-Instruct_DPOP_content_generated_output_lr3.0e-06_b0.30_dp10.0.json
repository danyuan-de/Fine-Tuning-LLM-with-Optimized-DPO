Heat conduction is the transfer of thermal energy through a material without the movement of the material itself. The rate of heat conduction is influenced by several factors, but the primary parameter that determines how well a material conducts heat is its thermal conductivity.\n\nThermal conductivity is a measure of a material's ability to conduct heat. It is defined as the amount of heat that passes through a unit area of a material in a unit time when there is a unit temperature difference between the two sides of the material. Materials with high thermal conductivity can efficiently transfer heat, while those with low thermal conductivity are poor heat conductors.\n\nComparing metals and wood:\n\n- **Metals** have high thermal conductivity. This is because their atoms are closely packed, and the electrons in the metal are free to move freely, carrying heat energy through the material. This free movement of electrons is known as electron conduction. Metals like copper and aluminum are excellent conductors of heat.\n\n- **Wood**, on the other hand, has a low thermal conductivity.
