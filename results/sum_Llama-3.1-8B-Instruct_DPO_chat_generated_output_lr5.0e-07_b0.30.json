Consider a heat engine that operates in a cycle, transferring heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir, and performing work in the process.\n2. Assume that the heat engine is 100% efficient, meaning it can convert all the heat energy put into it into useful work.\n3. This would imply that the heat engine can transfer heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir, which is a violation of the concept of entropy.\n4. Since entropy always increases in a spontaneous process, it is impossible to construct a heat engine that can convert all the heat energy put into it into useful work.\n\nTherefore, the Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics is:\n\n\"It is impossible to construct a heat engine that can convert all the heat energy put into it into useful work.\"\n\nIn other words, the Clausius statement states that the total entropy of an isolated system will always increase over time, and it is impossible to construct a heat engine that can convert all the heat energy put into it into useful work.",

This means that the system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, and there is no heat transfer between the system and the surroundings.\n\n- **Adiabatic Process**: An adiabatic process is a thermodynamic process in which there is no heat transfer between the system and its surroundings. This means that the system is thermally isolated from its surroundings, and no heat is exchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Key Differences**\n\n1. **Heat Transfer**: The primary difference between the two processes is the direction of heat transfer. In an isothermal process, there is no heat transfer, but in an adiabatic process, there is no heat transfer by definition.\n\n2. **Temperature Change**: In an isothermal process, the temperature of the system remains constant.
