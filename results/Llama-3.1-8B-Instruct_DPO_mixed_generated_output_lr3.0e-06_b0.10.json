However, since the rod is moving perpendicularly through the magnetic field, we can use the concept of a changing magnetic flux to induce an electromotive force (emf) in the rod. The relevant principle here is the one related to the change in magnetic flux through a loop.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the area of the loop\nSince the rod is moving perpendicularly through the magnetic field, we can consider the rod as a straight wire of length $L$ and treat it as a loop of area $A = L \\times w$, where $w$ is the width of the rod. However, the problem does not provide the width of the rod, but we can assume it to be negligible for the purpose of this calculation since the area of the rod is not directly relevant to the calculation of the induced emf in this scenario. The area of the rod is not necessary for the calculation of the induced emf in this case because the induced emf is given by the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the rod, and the rod's area does not change as it moves through the magnetic field.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the magnetic flux\nThe magnetic flux through the rod is given by $\\Phi_B = BA\\cos\\theta$, where $B$ is the magnetic field strength, $A$ is the area of the loop, and $\\theta$ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the loop.

Therefore, the magnetic flux through the rod is 0, and there will be no change in the magnetic flux as the rod moves through the field.\n Step 3:  However, since the rod is moving, we can consider the changing magnetic flux through a small area of the rod as it moves into or out of the magnetic field.

The direction of this induced current is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the fundamental laws of electromagnetism\nThere are several key laws related to electromagnetism, including Faraday's Law of Induction, Lenz's Law, and the Lorentz Force Law.

Conversely, if the magnetic flux is decreasing, the induced current will flow in a direction that opposes the decrease in flux.\n\n## Step 4: Relate Lenz's Law to the scenario\nGiven that the magnet is being moved towards the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil is increasing. According to Lenz's Law, the induced current in the coil will flow in a direction that opposes this increase in flux. This means the current will flow in a direction that creates a magnetic field that opposes the movement of the magnet towards the coil.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on the application of Lenz's Law, the direction of the induced current in the coil is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux caused by the moving magnet.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Lenz's Law}$",
